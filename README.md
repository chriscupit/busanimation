# Real Time Bus Tracker
This project maps a bus route using longitude and latitude coordinates between MIT and Harvard.  It cycles through a new position every second.  The marker goes from MIT to Harvard and back to MIT.  Once the marker reaches MIT it displays an alert that you have arrived back at MIT.  I changed the original color of the marker to orange.  
Once you open the site, you click on the button at the top left to watch the marker move to each position.
In the future I would like to expand on this project by adding some options for the user that would allow them to choose 
their desired bus route and to also have a stop button so the marker would stop at a certain location.  Adding some estimated times for different bus routes would also be a good option.
This project was completed through MIT xPro full stack development with MERN professional certificate in coding.
